## Features

Send pageviews and custom events to Plausible Analytics so you have privacy friendly
analytics.

This will log following information:

* A pageview or event
* Current page in the app (e.g. Homescreen)
* Operating System
* OS Version
* Referrer
* Screen width

Following information is generated by the Plausible server:

* Country
* Current time


## Getting started

Add this package to your project:

With the Flutter command:

     $ flutter pub add plausible_analytics

Or depend on it directly in your pubspec.yaml file (run an implicit `flutter pub get`):

    dependencies:
        plausible_analytics: ^0.1.0

Then import it in your Dart code where you want to have the analytics:

    import 'package:plausible_analytics/plausible_analytics.dart';

## Usage

For a simple pageview:

```dart
const String serverUrl = "https://plausible.io";
const String domain = "example.com";

final plausible = Plausible(serverUrl, domain);
final event = plausible.event();
```

Or for a custom event (e.g. a conversion):

```dart
const String serverUrl = "https://plausible.io";
const String domain = "example.com";

final plausible = Plausible(serverUrl, domain);
final event = plausible.event(
        name: 'conversion',
        page: 'homescreen',
        referrer: 'referrerPage');
```

Disable analytics (might be useful if a user opts out):

```dart
plausible.enabled = false;
```

You can also use a custom user agent but that is not recommended as
the default one already puts in the current Operation System & Version.
